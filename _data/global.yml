description: '"Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and remember it: Each of us lives only now, in this brief instant. The rest has been lived already or is impossible to see. The span we live is small - Small as the corner of the Earth in which we live it. Small as even the greatest renown, passed from mouth to mouth by short-lived stick figures, ignorant alike of themselves and those long dead."'
