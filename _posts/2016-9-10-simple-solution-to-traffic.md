Structually Systematized Solution. Self driving cars can talk to each other at the speed of light. So there's no need for an intersection.  No Intersections. No more traffic lights. No more monkeys driving cars

The best intersection is no intersection. 

The fundamental problem with traffic that you watch unfold, as with everything, is people. So the real simple solution to traffic is: no more monkeys driving cars.

What? What? Oh, I'm sorry, I thought this was America!
